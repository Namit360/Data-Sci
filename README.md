# Data-Sci

Hello,
These are my data science projects.

I have worked with some datasets analyzed them, tried to represent the data.

1. DATA_SCIENCE_PROJECT_CAR: In this project I cleaned the dataset and applied random forest regression algorithm to train and test the model. Decision tree algorithm is used to determine the accuracy. The predicted and original comparision plotting is done for selling price.

2. DATA_SCIENCE_PROJECT_FISH: In this project I cleaned the dataset and applied linear regression algorithm to train and test the model. r2 score is used to determine the accuracy. Clustering is used to show the data for fishes of different length.

3. DATA_SCIENCE_PROJECT_GPU: In this project I cleaned the dataset and applied linear regression algorithm to train and test the model. r2 score is used to determine the accuracy, mean squared error is also claculated. Data is represented in different manners.

4. DATA_SCIENCE_PROJECT_STOCKS: In this project I cleaned the dataset and applied linear regression algorithm to train and test the model. r2 score is used to determine the accuracy. Data is represented for only some companies. Stocks of only these companies are computed based on some selected features. The result is shown using plotting.
